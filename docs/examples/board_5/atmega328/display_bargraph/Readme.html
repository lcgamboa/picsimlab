  <h1>  LED bar graph</h1>
<pre>

  Turns on a series of LEDs based on the value of an analog sensor.
  This is a simple way to make a bar graph display. Though this graph uses 10
  LEDs, you can use any number by changing the LED count and the pins in the
  array.

  This method can be used to control any series of digital outputs that depends
  on an analog input.

  The circuit:
  - LEDs from pins 2 through 9 to ground
