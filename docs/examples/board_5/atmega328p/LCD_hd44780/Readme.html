  <h1>LCD hd44780 -  LiquidCrystal Library - Custom Characters  </h1>
<pre>
 Demonstrates how to add custom characters on an LCD  display.
 The LiquidCrystal library works with all LCD displays that are
 compatible with the  Hitachi HD44780 driver. There are many of
 them out there, and you can usually tell them by the 16-pin interface.

 This sketch prints "I <heart> Arduino!" and a little dancing man
 to the LCD.

  The circuit:
 * LCD RS pin to digital pin 12
 * LCD Enable pin to digital pin 11
 * LCD D4 pin to digital pin 5
 * LCD D5 pin to digital pin 4
 * LCD D6 pin to digital pin 3
 * LCD D7 pin to digital pin 2
 * LCD R/W pin to ground
 * 10K potentiometer:
 * ends to +5V and ground
 * wiper to LCD VO pin (pin 3)
 * 10K poterntiometer on pin A0
